This program runs a set of tests to see if introducing some variability to the
edge-weight phases in a Watts-Strogatz interferometer affects how interference
changes the small-world effect.

#Library imports 

#Function that creates a numpy array with randomized phase shifts

#Class for a WS model with phase variability

#Create a ws network

#Use masked array element-wise multiplication to randomly shift phases

#Return the new network

#Create a parameter space for these tests

#Write a function that performs each test

#Iterate through the tests
